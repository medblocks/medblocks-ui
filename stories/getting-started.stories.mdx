# Getting started

Medblocks UI is packaged as an ES Module and needs a modern bundler to work with your framework of choice. [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is blazing fast, and we'll be using that in this guide. [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/) is another alternative.

```
npm init @vitejs/app
```
Give your project a name
You are free to choose any framework, but for this tutorial we'll cover [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) since they have excellent [support for web components](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/). So it is recommended that you choose one of those.

`cd` into the directory you just created once vite has finished the setup and do `npm install`.

Install Medblocks UI:
```
npm install medblocks-ui
```

The next steps will look a little different based on the framework you choose, but it should be mostly the same.

## Svelte

Navigate to `src/App.svelte`

Include the following in the `<script>`
```jsx
<script>
    ...other content
    import Counter from './lib/Counter.svelte'

    import 'medblocks-ui/dist/medblocks'
    import '@shoelace-style/shoelace/dist/themes/base.css'
</script>
```

Now in the template let's include an `mb-input` element under `main`

```jsx
<main>
    <mb-input label="Hello world!"></mb-input>
    .
    .
    .
    ...other content
</main>
```
and it should render an input like so:

<mb-input label="Hello world!"></mb-input>

The alignment may be different because of the default css, but once you fix that, you're good to go!

## Vue

Navigate to `src/App.vue`

Include the following in the `<script>`
```jsx
<script>
    import 'medblocks-ui/dist/medblocks'
    import '@shoelace-style/shoelace/dist/themes/base.css'

    import { defineComponent } from 'vue'
    ...other content
</script>
```

Now in the template let's include an `mb-input` element in the `template`

```jsx
<template>
    <mb-input label="Hello world!" :data.prop="`Property bound in Vue`"></mb-input>
    .
    .
    .
    ...other content
</template>
```
and it should render an input like so:

<mb-input label="Hello world!" data="Property bound in Vue"></mb-input>

The alignment may be different because of the default css, but once you fix that, you're good to go!
