# Medblocks UI

Medblocks UI is a set of web components to be used for data capture in helathcare applications. It primarily supports converting openEHR templates into web components using the [VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tornadoalert.medblocks-ui). There is experimental support for FHIR Resources. 

## Installation

```
npm install medblocks-ui
```

## Concepts

All components are built on the [web components standard](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) using [Lit](https://lit.dev/). They are published using the [open-wc guidelines](https://open-wc.org/) and are published as ES modules. You will need to include polyfills, compile it and make transformations before using it in your projects. Look at the [getting started](?path=/story/getting-started--page) guide for more information.

You can use web components in any framework that [supports it](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/). React is well known to not support web components too well. However, there is a work around using [@lit-labs/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit-labs/react).


### Importing all

This will import everything that medblocks has to offer. This includes a set of default UI components for each data type build using [Shoelace.style](https://shoelace.style/) and Medblocks Forms.

```js
import `@shoelace-style/shoelace/dist/themes/base.css`
import 'medblocks-ui'
```

You can customize these elements by changing the css variables in the `base.css` file [from shoelace](https://shoelace.style/getting-started/customizing). Note that Medblocks UI components depends on the css file and will NOT work properly without including this.

### Cherry-picking

The `mb-form` component is the most important one, and helps generate data from other components as structured openEHR or FHIR compositions. There are no external dependencies and you can just import the `mb-form` module into your framework of choice:

```js
import 'medblocks-ui/dist/src/medblocks/form/form.js';
```
or for the form with the FHIR plugin:

```js
import 'medblocks-ui/dist/src/medblocks/form/fhirForm.js';
```

This will import and register `mb-form` or `mb-fhir-form` as a custom element.

Similarly for the `mb-input` element:
```
import 'medblocks-ui/dist/src/medblocks/text/input.js'
```

## How to use this Storybook

Each story has a canvas and a docs page. You can interact with the canvas, but the docs page has a table with a lot more details about the props and events that a component handles.
You can also see the code snippet for each story by clicking on "Show code". Try it out below!

<Canvas>
  <Story id="data-entry-coded-text-mb-select--base"></Story>
</Canvas>

You can view the full documentation of the above component (autogenerated from JSDocs) in the Docs section [here](/?path=/docs/data-entry-coded-text-mb-select--base).
