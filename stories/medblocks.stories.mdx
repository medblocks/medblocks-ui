# Medblocks UI

Medblocks UI is a set of web components to be used for data capture in helathcare applications. It primarily supports converting openEHR templates into web components using the [VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tornadoalert.medblocks-ui).

## Installation

For the time being, we recommend that you start with the open-wc and lit-element application to get started with web components.

```
npm init @open-wc
```
## Installation

For the time being, we recommend that you start with the open-wc application to get started with web components.

```
npm init @open-wc
```

Select Application, and then install medblocks-ui

```
npm install medblocks-ui
```
## Installation

For the time being, we recommend that you start with the open-wc application to use these web components. Documentation for other frameworks will be added soon.

```
npm init @open-wc
```

Select "Application", and select other features that you want. Then install medblocks-ui:

```
npm install medblocks-ui
```



## Concepts

All components are built on the [web components standard](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) using [Lit](https://lit.dev/). They are published using the [open-wc guidelines](https://open-wc.org/) and are published as modules compiled for ES2015. You will need to include polyfills and compile it down into bundles before using it in your projects.

You can use web components in any framework that [supports it](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/). React is well known to not support web components too well. However, there is a work around using [@lit-labs/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit-labs/react). But as mentioned above, starting with an open-wc application will is the fastest way to get up and running.

Medblocks UI consists of three parts:


### Form

The `mb-form` component is the most important one, and helps generate data from other components as structured openEHR compositions. There are no external dependencies and you can just import the `mb-form` module into your framework of choice:

```js
import 'medblocks-ui/dist/form';
```

or as a named import:

```js
import MbForm from 'medblocks-ui/dist/form';
```

This will import and register `mb-form` as a custom element.

### Data Entry

A set of default UI components for each data type build using [Shoelace.style](https://shoelace.style/). To use these components, you will have to import the shoelace base css first and then import all components like so:

```js
import `@shoelace-style/shoelace/dist/themes/base.css`
import 'medblocks-ui/dist/medblocks'
```

This will import the `mb-form` component as well. If you plan on cherry-picking components you want to use, you will have to import it from the `src` directory. For example, to import `mb-input`, we need to import the base styles then import like so:

```js
import `@shoelace-style/shoelace/dist/themes/base.css`
import 'medblocks-ui/dist/src/medblocks/text/input'
```

You can customize these elements by changing the css variables in the `base.css` file [from shoelace](https://shoelace.style/getting-started/customizing).

### Utility

A few utility functions and components that help handling data and submitting forms. These will be documented in their own section.

## How to use this Storybook

Each story has a canvas and a docs page. You can interact with the canvas, but the docs page has a table with a lot more details about the props and events that a component handles.
You can also see the code snippet for each story by clicking on "Show code". Try it out below!

<Canvas>
  <Story id="data-entry-coded-text-mb-select--base"></Story>
</Canvas>

You can view the full documentation of the above component (autogenerated from JSDocs) in the Docs section [here](/?path=/docs/data-entry-coded-text-mb-select--base).
