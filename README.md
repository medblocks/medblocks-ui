### Medblocks UI is now at v1 ðŸŽ‰ - with Typescript and React support out of the box

1. What does this mean ?

   We have heard all your requests and bug reports, developed a stable and tested release of Medblocks UI that is production grade. We have used this version internally over the past few months and ironed out the bugs we encountered.

2. What are the changes ?

   The familiar syntax of using web components within your project continues with the v1 release. We have enhanced the developer experience by making it easy to use and get started.

   - We have added Typescript support to all webcomponents fields and events which can be directly used
   - React is the most popular frontend library and it has lacked web component suppport since its inception, which meant that some intelligent hacks were required to make it work with React. But with V1 React components are output by default with Typescript typing for all the elements. Which means that you can add Medblocks UI to your existing project with ease.

To get started with React take a look at our documentation for React [here.](https://medblocks.com/docs/medblocks-ui/react)

## Getting Started

Medblocks UI is a web component library for building openEHR and FHIR UIs. It extends an array of web components that is compatible with all frameworks. You can use the Medblocks UI VSCode Extension to create the UI elements for you [here.](https://medblocks.com/docs/medblocks-ui/VSCode%20Extension)

## Quick Start - For HTML

### Import the JS to your HTML file

```html title="index.html"
<head>
  ...
  <!-- Styles -->
  <link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@shoelace-style/shoelace@2.9.0/cdn/themes/light.css"
  />
</head>
<body>
  ...
  <!-- Main Package -->
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/medblocks-ui@0.0.180/dist/bundle.js"></script>
</body>
```

If you want to use it with other frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, etc. You can check out the installation page.

### Create a form based on a template

The template used in the example is [blood_pressure](https://medblocks.com/docs/blood_pressure.json). It captures two simple fields - Systolic, Diastolic blood pressure and Date Time at which it was captured.
Medblocks UI supports the FlatPath format of openEHR compositions.

First lets add the necessary contexts to the form such as language, category and territory. We will use the `mb-context` with the path attribute to add the contexts.

```html
<mb-form>
  <mb-context path="blood_pressure/language" />
  <mb-context path="blood_pressure/encoding" />
  <mb-context path="blood_pressure/subject" />
</mb-form>
```

Then we add the necessary fields to capture the data.

```html title="index.html"
<mb-form>
  <mb-context path="blood_pressure/language" />
  <mb-context path="blood_pressure/encoding" />
  <mb-context path="blood_pressure/subject" />
  <mb-quantity
    default="mm[Hg]"
    path="blood_pressure/any_event:0/systolic"
    label="Systolic"
  >
    <mb-unit unit="mm[Hg]" label="mm[Hg]" min="" max="1000"></mb-unit>
  </mb-quantity>
  <mb-quantity
    default="mm[Hg]"
    path="blood_pressure/any_event:0/diastolic"
    label="Diastolic"
  >
    <mb-unit unit="mm[Hg]" label="mm[Hg]" min="" max="1000"></mb-unit>
  </mb-quantity>
  <mb-context path="blood_pressure/any_event:0/time"></mb-context>
</mb-form>
```

The same is rendered as:

Now add a submit button so that we can submit the composition.

```html
...
<body>
  <mb-form>
    ...
    <mb-submit> Submit </mb-submit>
  </mb-form>
</body>
```

Now listen to the submit event and submit the composition.

```html
...
<body>
  <mb-form id="form"> ... </mb-form>
  <script>
    // Listen to the submit event
    document
      .getElementbyId('form')
      .addEventListener('mb-submit', async function (e) {
        await fetch('<server-url>', {
          method: 'POST',
          headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
          },
          body: JSON.stringify(e.target.data),
        });
      });
  </script>
</body>
```
